Project language is Python. Most common possible linting options seems to be Pylint, flake8 and mypy. From these Pylint is chosen because some sources say that Pylint catches more PEP8 coding standard violations thus rendering it more feasible option for project. Pylint also seems to be more mainstream than mypy another reason for our choice. There is probably more info about that linter should any weird errors appear during development process.
In testing we want to keep it light because the team is relatively small. There is still unit testing and integration testing. Crucial thing are tested e.g. unauthorized user cannot get access to secured endpoints and prevent any infinite loops that store constantly new data to database. We have decided to aim for 40 precedent testing coverage. Testing will be done using unittest. Despite its name it can also do integration test that are important even if they are bit more labor intensive. Unit test will be combined with nose2 in order to provide developers with more humane working conditions when they are reading the test logs when there is a fail during pull request.
Different CI alternatives are: TeamCity, Drone.io, Gitlabs integrated CI, GoCD, Jenkins, Strider, Bamboo.
Assumption is that setup environment is cloud-based. Because we are ready to sacrifice control for speed. Reasons for better educated decision would be how familiar developers are with CI/CD processes, how much muscle the tests are requiring, how big of a workload the building of the app is and how soon there must be first version of working app running.
